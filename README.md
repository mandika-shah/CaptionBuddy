- Generates captions for images using deep learning models.
- Supports various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
- Built-in error handling for unsupported file types and large files.

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- Django Framework
- TensorFlow (for the image captioning model)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend development)
- SQLite (for the database)
